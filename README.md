# Decentralized Identity for Gym Access

This Web3 project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized identity system for gym access, replacing physical membership cards. It enables secure, verifiable, and user-controlled access to gym facilities while ensuring privacy and interoperability across multiple gym chains.

## ✨ Features

🔑 **Decentralized Identity Creation**: Users create a unique digital identity tied to their Stacks wallet.  
🏋️ **Gym Access Control**: Gyms verify user identities for entry using blockchain-based credentials.  
🔒 **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure minimal data disclosure during verification.  
🔄 **Interoperable Memberships**: Users can access multiple partnered gyms with a single identity.  
📜 **Immutable Access Logs**: Track entry history securely on the blockchain.  
⚙️ **Subscription Management**: Handle membership subscriptions and renewals on-chain.  
🚫 **Revoke Access**: Gyms or users can revoke access credentials if needed.  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Users**  
- Create a decentralized identity (DID) with a unique identifier and public/private key pair.  
- Register a gym membership by interacting with the membership contract, specifying subscription details.  
- Gain entry by presenting a verifiable credential at the gym, validated via a zero-knowledge proof.  
- Manage subscriptions (renew, cancel) through the subscription contract.  

**For Gyms**  
- Verify user credentials using the verification contract without accessing sensitive data.  
- Issue or revoke access permissions through the access control contract.  
- View access logs for auditing or dispute resolution.  

**For Verifiers (Third Parties)**  
- Check membership validity or access history via public contract functions.  

This system eliminates the need for physical cards, reduces fraud, and enhances user control over their data.
